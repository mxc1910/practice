    <p>The <strong>Macintosh 128K</strong>, originally released as the <strong>Apple Macintosh</strong>, is the original <strong>Apple Macintosh</strong> personal computer.</p>

    <p>Its beige case consists of a 9 <abbr title="inch">in</abbr> (23 <abbr title="centimiter">cm</abbr>) <strong>CRT monitor</strong> and comes with a <strong>keyboard and mouse</strong>. A handle built into the top of the case makes it easier for the computer to be lifted and carried. It's selling price is <strong>$2,495</strong>.</p>

    <p>The Macintosh was introduced by the now-famous <em>$370,000 television commercial</em> directed by <strong>Ridley Scott</strong>, <em>"1984"</em>, which aired on CBS during the third quarter of <strong>Super Bowl XVIII</strong> on <time datetime="1984-01-22">January 22, 1984</time>.</p>

    <h2>Processor and Memory</h2>

    <p>The heart of the computer is a <strong>Motorola 68000 microprocessor</strong> running at <em>7.8336 <abbr title="megahertz">MHz</abbr></em>, connected to <strong>128 KB RAM</strong> shared by the processor and the display controller.</p>

    <h2>Peripherals</h2>

    <p>The built-in display is a <strong>one-bit, black-and-white, 9-inch (23 cm) <abbr title="Cathode Ray Tube">CRT</abbr></strong> with a fixed resolution of <strong>512 Ã— 342 pixels</strong>, establishing the desktop publishing standard of <strong>72 <abbr title="Pixels per inch">PPI</abbr></strong>.</p>

    <p>An external <strong>floppy disk drive</strong> can be added using <em>a proprietary connector</em>. The keyboard and mouse use simple proprietary protocols, allowing some third-party upgrades.</p>

    <h2>Storage</h2>

    <p><strong>The Macintosh</strong> contains a <em>single 400 <abbr title= "kilobyte">KB</abbr>, single-sided 3 1/2-inch floppy disk drive</em>, dedicating no space to other internal mechanical storage. <strong>The Mac OS</strong> was disk-based from the beginning, as <em><abbr title="Random access memory">RAM</abbr></em> had to be conserved, but this <strong>"Startup Disk"</strong> could still be temporarily ejected. One floppy disk was sufficient to store the <strong>System Software</strong>, an application and the data files created with the application.</p>
